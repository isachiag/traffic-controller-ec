# Pico y Placa predictor

Using object-oriented, tested code in Ruby, write a *pico y placa* predictor.

The inputs should be
- a license plate number (the full number, not the last digit)
- a date (as a String)
- a time (as a String)

And the program will return whether or not that car can be on the road.

The solution should demonstrate good object-oriented code with unit tests.

# Test
``` sh
ruby test.rb
```
